Write a python script to calculate a users age given the birth year

The program should have the following features:
    1. Accept the following information from the user(in lower case):
        a.  First name
        b.  Middle name
        c.  Last name
        d.  Birth year

    2. Calculate the the users current age using the birth year (formula: 2022 - birth year

    3. Print a message using the users initials and calculated age

    e.g: if the user entered 'mike', 'james', 'okoh' and 1979 as the First name, Middle name, Last name and birth year respectively, and the calculated age is 43, the ouput should be:

    "Hello, MJ Okoh, you were born in 1979, you are currently 43 years old"
